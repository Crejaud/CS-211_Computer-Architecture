# Computer Architecture (Spring 2015)

pa1 - First programming assignment (Basic data structures in C90)

	In pa1, there exist 5 mini programs on data structures in C90.

pa2 - Second programming assignment (HashTable with LinkedLists in C90)

	In pa2, the premise is to read millions of lines from a text file
	and insert them into a hashTable of size 1000 with Linked Lists to prevent
	collisions.

pa3 - Third programming assignment (Reading compiled c code in x86 and defusing a bomb)

	pa3 has not been posted since it only deals with reading compiled c code in x86 assembly.
	There was no programming, just analysis.

pa4 - Fourth programming assignment (Simulate a combinational circuit)

	In pa4, the premise is to read from two text files, 
	simulate a combinational circuit using a tree-like data structure,
	and given input produce output.
	
	The combinational gates used:
	- AND gate
	- OR gate
	- NOT gate
	- DECODER (input read as gray code)
	- MULTIPLEXER (input read as gray code)
